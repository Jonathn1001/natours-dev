The Rest Architecture

1.  Separate API into logical resources (// ? any information that can be named can be resource)
2.  Expose structured, resource-based URLs.
3.  Use HTTP methods (verbs).
4.  Send data as JSON (usually).
5.  Be stateless.
    // ? This means that each request must contain all the information necessary to process a certain request\
     // ? The server should not have to remember previous requests.
